# Thousand-Separator---String-format

Formats value by separating thousands.

Example: 100000 is transformed into 100.000

Note that when used in an input field for live transformation, 
it is necessary to assign the function to the onKeyUp event, 
it cannot be used with onKeyPress, as this event never captures the most recently pressed key.
